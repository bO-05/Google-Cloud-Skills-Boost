# Generative AI Explained

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that deals with the creation of intelligent agents which are systems that can reason, learn and act autonomously. Essentially, AI has to do with the theory and methods to build machines that think and act like humans.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of AI. It is a program or system that trains a model from input data. The trained model can then make useful predictions from new or never-before-seen data drawn from the same distribution as the one used to train the model.

Machine Learning gives the computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. 2 of the most common classes of ML models are unsupervised and supervised ML models.

- Supervised Learning: The model learns from past examples to predict future values. For example, predicting tips based on total bill amount and whether the order was picked up or delivered.

- Unsupervised Learning: Used for discovery and finding natural groups in data. For example, clustering employees into groups like "fast track" based on tenure and income.

## What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks allowing them to process more complex patterns than machine learning. Artificial Neural Networks are inspired by the human brain. They are made up of many interconnected nodes or neurons that can learn to perform tasks by processing data and making predictions.

Deep learning models typically have many layers of neurons, which allows them to learn more complex patterns than traditional machine learning models. Neural networks can use both labeled and unlabeled data. This is called semi-supervised learning.

In semi-supervised learning, a neural network is trained on a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. The labeled data helps the neural network to learn the basic concepts of the task while the unlabeled data helps the neural network to generalize to new examples.

## What is Generative AI?

Generative AI (Gen AI) is a type of artificial intelligence that creates new content based on what it has learned from existing content. The process of learning from existing content is called training and results in the creation of a statistical model.

When given a prompt, Gen AI uses the model to predict what an expected response might be, and this generates new content.

Essentially, it learns the underlying structure of the data and can then generate new samples that are similar to the data it was trained on.

A generative language model can take what it learned from the examples it's been shown and create something entirely new based on that information. Large language models are one type of generative AI since they generate novel combinations of text in the form of natural sounding language.

Gen AI depends a lot on the training data that you have fed into it. It analyzes the patterns and structures of the input data and thus learns. But with access to a browser-based prompt, you, the user, can generate your own content.

## Model Types

There are several types of generative models:

- Text-to-text: Takes text input and produces text output. Used for translation, summarization, etc.
- Text-to-image: Generates images from text descriptions. Uses diffusion models.
- Text-to-video and Text-to-3D: Generate videos and 3D objects from text.
- Text-to-task: Perform a defined task like answering a question, searching, or taking an action based on text input.

## Foundation Models

A foundation model is a large AI model pre-trained on a vast quantity of data designed to be adapted or fine-tuned to a wide range of downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis, image captioning, and object recognition.

Foundation models have the potential to revolutionize many industries including healthcare, finance, and customer service. They can be used to detect fraud, provide personalized customer support, and more.

Vertex AI offers a model garden that includes foundation models. The language foundation models include PALM API for chat and text. The Vision Foundation models include Stable Diffusion, which generates high-quality images from text.

## Applications

There are many applications of generative AI, including:

- Code generation: Help debug code, explain code line-by-line, generate SQL queries, translate between languages, generate documentation, etc.
- Generative AI Studio: Explore and customize GAI models. Includes free trained models, tools to fine-tune and deploy models, and a community forum.
- Generative AI App Builder: Drag and drop interface to build apps with digital assistants, search, knowledge bases, training apps, and more without code.
- PALM API: Test and experiment with Google's large language models and Gen AI tools. Integrates with maker suite to access the API through a GUI.
- Model training, deployment and monitoring tools: Helps train, deploy and monitor ML models.
