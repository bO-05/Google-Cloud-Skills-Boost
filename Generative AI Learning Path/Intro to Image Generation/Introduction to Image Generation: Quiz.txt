Which process involves a model learning to remove noise from images?
Reverse diffusion

What is the goal of diffusion models?
To learn the latent structure of a dataset by modeling the way in which data points diffuse through the latent space

What is the process of forward diffusion?
Start with a clean image and add noise iteratively

What are some challenges of diffusion models?
All of the above

What is the name of the model family that draws inspiration from physics and thermodynamics?
Diffusion models
